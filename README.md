# Diabetes_prediction
We want to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features

#  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Overview

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using Machine Learning algorithms.

The goal of this project is to build an accurate classification model that can help in early diabetes detection.

##  Dataset Details

* Total Records: 768
* Total Features: 8
* Target Variable: Outcome

| Pregnancies              | Number of times pregnant       |
| Glucose                  | Plasma glucose concentration   |
| BloodPressure            | Diastolic blood pressure       |
| SkinThickness            | Triceps skin fold thickness    |
| Insulin                  | 2-Hour serum insulin           |
| BMI                      | Body Mass Index                |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes hereditary function   |
| Age                      | Age of patient                 |
| Outcome                  | 0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic |
