#  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Overview

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using Machine Learning algorithms.

The goal of this project is to build an accurate classification model that can help in early diabetes detection.

##  Dataset Details

* Total Records: 768
* Total Features: 8
* Target Variable: Outcome
